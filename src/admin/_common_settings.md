Common settings:

- `SEABIRD_ID` (optional, defaults to `seabird`) - (TODO: determine what this is
  and why it's not supported everywhere)
- `SEABIRD_HOST` (required) - this is the URL of the `seabird-core` instance.
  Most users should use `https://core.seabird.chat`
- `SEABIRD_TOKEN` (required) - the seabird token

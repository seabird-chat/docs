Common settings:

- `SEABIRD_ID` (optional, defaults to `seabird`) - internal "id" of the backend,
  used for identification purposes. This must be unique between backends. It
  may be dropped or ignored in future versions of the seabird APIs.
- `SEABIRD_HOST` (required) - this is the URL of the `seabird-core` instance.
  Most users should use `https://core.seabird.chat`
- `SEABIRD_TOKEN` (required) - the seabird token
